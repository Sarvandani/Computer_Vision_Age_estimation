# 🎯 Age Estimation Using DeepFace (Google Colab)

This repository contains a simple Python script to estimate the age of faces in an image using the [DeepFace](https://github.com/serengil/deepface) library. The code is designed to run in **Google Colab**, making it easy to use without local setup.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Load image from a public URL (e.g., PostImage)
- ✅ Detect one or multiple faces in the image
- ✅ Estimate the **age** of each detected face
- ✅ Display the input image
- ✅ Supports `.jpg`, `.png`, and other standard image formats

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3 (Google Colab provides this)
- DeepFace library (installed within the notebook)
- Internet connection (required for model downloads and image fetching)

---

## 📥 Installation

You only need to install **DeepFace**. The script already handles this:

```python
!pip install deepface
